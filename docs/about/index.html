    Hello. I use engineering principles to understand nature for the purpose of conservation. This has led me to work on a broad range of projects - from 3D printing human cells for tissue engineering to studing sea sponge for closed loop wastewater treatment aboard the International Space Station. My research follows a consistent arc - use the power observation to gain scientific understand and then use that understanding for conservation, which has meant growing a model liver to replace animal models during drug testing or using biochemistry to synthesize insulin for human missions to space.
